# AutoMapper

**AutoMapper** is a lightweight and easy-to-use object-to-object mapping library for Java. It dynamically maps fields between objects using reflection, supporting both standard Java classes and records.

## Features

- **Automatic Mapping**: Automatically maps fields between objects with matching names.
- **Record Support**: Maps domain objects to Java records and vice versa.
- **List Mapping**: Easily map lists of objects.
- **Zero Configuration**: No annotations or configurations are required.
- **Open Contribution**: Open-source and welcoming contributions from anyone.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your Maven `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.nobeleskinder</groupId>
    <artifactId>automapper</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

For Gradle:

```gradle
implementation 'io.github.nobeleskinder:automapper:1.0.0'
```

## Usage

### Mapping Between Classes
```java
User user = new User("Alice", 30);
UserDTO userDTO = AutoMapper.map(user, UserDTO.class);
System.out.println(userDTO);
```

### Mapping Lists
```java
List<User> users = List.of(new User("Alice", 30), new User("Bob", 25));
List<UserDTO> userDTOList = AutoMapper.mapList(users, UserDTO.class);
userDTOList.forEach(System.out::println);
```

### Mapping Records
```java
UserDTO userDTO = new UserDTO("Alice", 30);
User user = AutoMapper.map(userDTO, User.class);
System.out.println(user);
```
